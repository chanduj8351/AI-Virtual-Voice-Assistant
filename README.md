# AI Virtual Voice Assistant 🤖

**AI‑Virtual‑Voice‑Assistant** is a conversational voice‑powered assistant built with speech‑to‑text and text‑to‑speech capabilities. It accepts spoken commands, processes them using AI/NLP, and replies via synthesized speech, enabling hands‑free interactions for tasks like web search, system control, news, weather, and more.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Speech‑to‑Text (STT):** Captures and converts user voice via microphone input.
* **Text‑to‑Speech (TTS):** Vocalizes AI responses for natural conversation.
* **Voice Interaction Loop:** Listen → Understand → Respond flow with wake‑word or continuous mode.
* **Task Handling / Domain Tools:**

  * Web search
  * General queries & knowledge base responses
  * Local system operations (e.g. open/close apps, browser control)
  * Fetching news and weather (if configured)
* **Extensible Plugin Architecture:** Add custom modules or AI agents to support new skills.

---

## 🧾 Prerequisites

* **Python 3.7+**
* Microphone and speaker/audio output
* API keys (if applicable):

  * Speech recognition (e.g. Deepgram / Whisper API, or offline alternatives)
  * Text‑to‑speech engine (e.g. pyttsx3, Google TTS, ElevenLabs, etc.)
  * Search engine or knowledge base access
  * News API / Weather API (optional, if assistant supports those features)

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chanduj8351/AI‑Virtual‑Voice‑Assistant.git
   cd AI‑Virtual‑Voice‑Assistant
   ```

2. Optionally create and activate a virtual environment

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` or configuration file:

   * Add your API keys and configuration settings such as:

     ```text
     STT_API_KEY=…
     TTS_API_KEY=…
     SEARCH_API_KEY=…
     NEWS_API_KEY=…
     WEATHER_API_KEY=…
     ```

---

## 🏃 Running the Assistant

Launch the assistant with:

```bash
python main.py
```

* The assistant listens and waits for commands (via wake‑word or activation phrase).
* You can exit the session by saying **“goodbye”** or **“exit”**.

---

## 🔧 Example Use Cases

* **Task:** *“Search the web for space exploration news”*
  → Assistant retrieves and speaks current news.

* **System Control:** *“Open Google Chrome”* or *“Close current window”*.

* **General Query:** *“What’s the weather in New York?”* (if a weather plugin is enabled)

* **Knowledge Base Query:** *“What did I save about Python in my notes?”*

## 🔌 Extending Functionality

To add support for new commands or domains:

1. Create a new plugin .py file in the `plugins/` folder.
2. Define a command or intent handler.
3. Register it in the main conversation loop.
4. Test with voice input to ensure proper integration.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions and suggestions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request.
Consider:

* Adding support for more speech engines (Whisper, Vosk, Deepgram)
* Improving intent parsing via bigger language models
* Integrating new tool modules (calendar, email, reminders, etc.)
